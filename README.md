Hey there 👋

I’m Prajan, an aspiring AI & Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist.

I like building things that think, learn, and automate — from machine learning models and AI agents to data-driven systems that solve real problems.

One project I’m particularly proud of is **QORE, a quantum machine learning platform** where I explore how quantum concepts can enhance modern ML workflows.

Most of my learning happens by building, breaking, and rebuilding — working with real data, real constraints, and real ideas.

**What I usually work on**

‣ Machine learning & data science

‣ AI agents and LLM-based systems

‣ Automation and intelligent workflows

‣ Experimental and research-driven projects

**Tools I’m comfortable with**

‣ Python, SQL

‣ Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

‣ Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

‣ Git, GitHub, Jupyter, n8n

**Outside the code**

‣ Curious about future AI systems

‣ Enjoy exploring complex ideas

‣ Always learning, always building
